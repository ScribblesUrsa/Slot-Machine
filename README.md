# Slot-Machine
Design a game where the user can play a make believe slot machine. 
The user will be asked to make a wager to play various lines in a 3 x 3 grid. 
They can play center line, all three horizontal lines, all vertical lines and diagonals.
For instance the user can enter $3 dollars and play all three horizontal lines. If the top line hits a winning combination, they earn $1 dollar for that line.
This program will use 20 different characters, an average number of combination per reel.
